UNIFIED_GATEWAY=true                      # Enable unified Gateway mode (SRA + Gateway in one pod)
VERSION=""                                # Optional: set a specific image tag; empty = pull default/latest

# ===== 2) Observability =====
ENABLE_METRICS=false                      # "true" to expose Gateway metrics (Prometheus scrape, etc.)

# ===== 3) Authentication to Akeyless (required) =====
GATEWAY_ACCESS_ID=p-xxxxxx                  # The Access ID to authenticate the Gateway
GATEWAY_ACCESS_TYPE=xxxxxx                  # REQUIRED for SRA. One of: access_key/password/saml/ldap/k8s/azure_ad/oidc/aws_iam/universal_identity/jwt/gcp/cert/oci/kerberos
GATEWAY_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxx                   # Access key/secret/token as applicable to the access type

# Optional allow-list for Access IDs that may use this Gateway.

# ===== 5) TLS manager / configuration =====

# ===== 6) Caching controls =====
# If you want to turn OFF caching, set USE_CLUSTER_CACHE=false and GATEWAY_CLUSTER_CACHE=disable.

GATEWAY_CLUSTER_CACHE=enable              # Cluster cache toggle for Gateway ("enable"/"disable")
USE_CLUSTER_CACHE=true                    # Use Redis-backed cluster cache
PREFER_CLUSTER_CACHE_FIRST=true           # Prefer cached reads before remote fetch where applicable
PROACTIVE_CACHE_ENABLE=false              # Legacy/alt flag – keep as provided
NEW_PROACTIVE_CACHE_ENABLE=true           # Newer proactive cache flag – keep as provided
PRO_ACTIVE_CACHE_ENABLE=true              # Alias/legacy flag – keep as provided
#CUSTOMER_FRAGMENTS='{"customer_fragments": [{"id": "cf-*************","value": "4zm7UXxpkm********************************************XuOAI3riEA=="}]}'
